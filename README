README


##############################################################

This is the git repository for IFB299 Group 114

This repository was started by git user leexsen

The aim of this project is to develop a 'smart city' web application using Django Framework, HTML, CSS and Javascript

Throughout the development of this app, the associated students are expected to familiarise themselves with the SCRUM protocol of development. Each member of the group will be assigned a simulated role from the following list: user, developer, or SCRUM master.

Students in the User role will gain a further understanding of the user experience, and come to understand the client mindset by simulating it.

Students in the Developer role will learn how to perform SCRUM sprints, as well as write sprint retrospectives. This will familiarise students with the 80/20 rule, and teach them to prioritise the most important features of their application.

Students in the SCRUM master role will learn how to organise a team. This responsibility includes: Managing conflict, assembling sprints, and interpreting client requests. 

Group 114 has elected to rotate their SCRUM master weekly, to make the group dynamic feel more democratic.

This project will last approximately 13 weeks, the duration of QUT's second semester of 2017 (17se2).
